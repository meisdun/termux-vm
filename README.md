# Termux VM
TermuxVM allows you to use [ArchLinux](https://www.archlinux.org/) running on the [QEMU emulator](https://www.qemu.org/). This should give the experience of using the original distribution of ArchLinux with all its functions, but due to the fact that the operating system is running in the emulator, the performance will be much lower.
